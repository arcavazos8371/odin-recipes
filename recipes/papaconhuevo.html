        <br> This taco has not failed to satisfy even the most picky of eaters.
        <br> The simple combination of scrambled eggs and fried diced potatoes,coupled with basic salt and pepper, is just enough to get you through to lunch.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 stick melted butter or 1/2 a cup of oil</li>
        <li>1 Potato </li>
        <li>2-4 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Flour or Corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the Potato and wash it off. chop potatoes to desired thickness. (You may choose to have the potatoes soak in water to get excess starch out. That is not required.)</li>
            <li>Get a pan (Preferably a cast iron skillet) and put on the stove with med to mid high heat. Pour oil in and allow to heat up for 2-3 min.</li>
            <li>Put potatoes in the pan and fry till they start to brown. Make sure that the potato is easy to cut through with the spatula or whichever utensil you are using before you add the eggs.</li>
            <li>Drain any excess oil from the pan and now you can start putting the eggs in. Salt and pepper to taste. (You can scramble them outside in a bowl if preferred.) </li>
            <li>Heat tortillas on a metal pan. If you want to heat them like my fellow Mexican Americans do at home, a Comal similar to <a href= https://www.walmart.com/ip/HEAVY-DUTY-Tortilla-Cook-Griddle-Cast-Iron-10-Inch-Grill-10-INCH-By-Comal/883602514 >this</a> would be good. </li>
