    <h2>A simple but delicious taco </h2>
    <p>This is another South Texas classic. The grease from bacon is saved and used in this dish.
        <br> The chorizo mixed in with the refried beans is one of the most satisfying and savory combinations on the planet.
        <br> Couple this with the broken up bacon you just made and you got yourself a mouthful.
